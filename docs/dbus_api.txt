MEO Cloud D-Bus API description
**********************************


Main D-Bus Interface
=======================
This interface runs on the GUI application
and can be called to request information
or to fulfill simple tasks.
=======================


Service     pt.meocloud.dbus
Interface   pt.meocloud.dbus
Object path	/pt/meocloud/dbus

Methods     int Status()

                Returns the status of the MEO Cloud core.
                
                int status:
                    0 = CORE_INITIALIZING
                    1 = CORE_AUTHORIZING
                    2 = CORE_WAITING
                    3 = CORE_SYNCING
                    4 = CORE_READY
                    5 = CORE_PAUSED
                    6 = CORE_ERROR
                    7 = CORE_SELECTIVE_SYNC
                    8 = CORE_RESTARTING
                    9 = CORE_OFFLINE
            
            bool[] FileInCloud(string path)
            
                Returns if the file belongs in the user's MEO Cloud,
                its sync status and its ignored status.
                
                bool in_cloud:
                    true if the file belongs to the user's MEO Cloud
                bool is_syncing:
                    true if the file is syncing
                bool is_ignored:
                    true if the file is ignored for some reason
            
            bool FileIgnored(string path)
            
                Returns if the file is ignored.
                
                bool is_ignored:
                    true if the file is ignored by the core
            
            void ShareFolder(string path)
            
                Shares the specified folder.
                
            void ShareLink(string path)
            
                Shares the specified file.
                
            void OpenInBrowser(string path)
            
                Opens the file in MEO Cloud in the browser.
                
            string GetCloudHome()
            
                Returns the path to the user's MEO Cloud folder.
                
            string GetAppPath()
            
                Returns the path to the MEO Cloud application's folder.
                

Shell D-Bus Interface
=======================
This interface runs on the file manager
extensions and is notified when there
are file status changes. It is usually
set as replaceable by other applications.
=======================

Service     pt.meocloud.shell
Interface   pt.meocloud.shell
Object path	/pt/meocloud/shell

Methods     void UpdateFile(string path)

                This method is called by the MEO Cloud application when a
                file status is updated. This allows file manager extensions
                to refresh the emblems as necessary.
