MEOCloud Plugin for Pantheon Files >= 0.2

Overview:
- Pantheon Files 0.2 breaks the previous plugin ABI
- If an outdated plugin is installed,
  there's a very good chance Pantheon Files will crash.
- Some (very) important methods have been moved to the Vala
  side of Pantheon Files. They were previously in the C side.
  The old Pantheon Files plugin had a custom vapi file, which
  is responsible for binding Vala methods to C. This way, we
  could access methods that weren't normally accessible.
  As of today (20-05-2014), it's not possible to create the
  kind of plugin we need for Pantheon Files 0.2 because of
  the unavailable methods.

To do:
1. Fix the API issues or wait for a fix from upstream.
2. Rewrite parts of the plugin to comply with the API changes.
3. Recompile for elementary OS Isis.
4. Kill D-Bus and implement Unix sockets.

Current state:
1. I'm getting this issue fixed upstream. Hopefully.
   A branch with the required changes is available
   in Launchpad, but is waiting for a review. I could
   review and merge it myself but I'd rather not do it.
2. I've rewrote some parts but as there isn't a fix
   upstream yet there's no guarantee it won't need
   more changes.
3. Requires above items to be dealt with before
   a final build. It currently builds successfuly.
4. An implementation has been started but isn't
   ready yet. Thrift does not currently support
   Vala and as such I've tried embedding Python
   inside Vala using the Python C API. All the
   Thrift functionality is implemented in Python.
   However, this brings a few issues that I haven't
   yet been able to solve.
