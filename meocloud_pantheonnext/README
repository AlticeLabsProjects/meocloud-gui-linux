MEOCloud Plugin for Pantheon Files >= 0.2

Overview:
- Pantheon Files 0.2 breaks the previous plugin ABI
- If an outdated plugin is installed,
  there's a very good chance Pantheon Files will crash.
- Some (very) important methods have been moved to the Vala
  side of Pantheon Files. They were previously in the C side.
  The old Pantheon Files plugin had a custom vapi file, which
  is responsible for binding Vala methods to C. This way, we
  could access methods that weren't normally accessible.
  As of today (20-05-2014), it's not possible to create the
  kind of plugin we need for Pantheon Files 0.2 because of
  the unavailable methods.

To do:
1. Fix the API issues or wait for a fix from upstream.
2. Rewrite parts of the plugin to comply with the API changes.
3. Recompile for elementary OS Isis.

Current state:
1. I'm getting this issue fixed upstream. Hopefully.
2. I've rewrote some parts but as there isn't a fix
   upstream yet there's no guarantee it won't need
   more changes.
3. Requires above items to be dealt with before
   a final build. It currently builds successfuly.
